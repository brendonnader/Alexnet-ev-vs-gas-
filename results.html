    <h2>Results & Visualizations</h2>

    <!-- TRAINING CURVES -->
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Loss Over Epochs</h3>
      <img src="images/trainingvsloss.png" alt="Training vs Validation Loss" />
      <p class="figure-caption">
        Figure 1: Training and validation loss across 10 epochs. The curves fluctuate,
        which suggests the model is having trouble finding a stable minimum, likely due
        to the small dataset and noisy gradients.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Accuracy Over Epochs</h3>
      <img src="images/trainingvsvalid.png" alt="Training vs Validation Accuracy" />
      <p class="figure-caption">
        Figure 2: Training accuracy peaks at about 75.9%, while validation accuracy
        stays between roughly 42% and 57%. This gap shows that the model fits the
        training data better than the validation data and does not generalize very well.

    <!-- CONFUSION MATRIX -->
    <h2>Confusion Matrix</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <img src="images/confusion matrix.png" alt="Confusion Matrix" />
      <p class="figure-caption">
        Figure 3: Confusion matrix on the test set. The model predicted all cars as Gas:
        83 Gas cars were correctly classified, but 112 Electric cars were all
        misclassified as Gas. This leads to a final test accuracy of 42.56% and
        shows that the model completely fails to recognize the Electric class.

    <!-- EXAMPLE PREDICTIONS -->
    <h2>Example Predictions</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Correct Predictions</h3>
      <img src="images/correct prediction.png" alt="Correct Predictions" />
      <p class="figure-caption">
        Figure 4: Examples where the model correctly predicted Gas for gas-powered
        vehicles. These examples show that the model has learned some useful
        gas-vehicle features such as body shape and overall appearance.
      </p>

      <h3>Incorrect Predictions</h3>
      <img src="images/incorrect.png" alt="Incorrect Predictions" />
      <p class="figure-caption">
        Figure 5: Examples where Electric vehicles were incorrectly classified as Gas.
        Many of these cars look visually similar to gas sedans, and the model is heavily
        biased toward the Gas label.

    <!-- KEY TAKEAWAYS -->
    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Final test accuracy is <strong>42.56%</strong>. The model performs better than random,
          but is not reliable enough for real-world deployment.
        </li>
        <li>
          The confusion matrix shows <strong>0 Electric cars correctly classified</strong> and
          83 Gas cars correct – the model always predicts Gas.
        </li>
        <li>
          This behavior suggests dataset issues (size/imbalance) and the need for more
          tuning: more Electric images, more epochs, and stronger augmentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Even with limitations, the project demonstrates the full deep learning pipeline:
          data preprocessing, AlexNet fine-tuning, evaluation, and visualization.
        </li>
