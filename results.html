    Figure 1: Training and validation loss across 10 epochs. The curves fluctuate,
    which suggests the model is having trouble finding a stable minimum, likely due
    to the small dataset and noisy gradients.

  <h3>Accuracy Over Epochs</h3>

    Figure 2: Training accuracy peaks at about 75.9%, while validation accuracy
    stays between roughly 42% and 57%. This gap shows that the model fits the
    training data better than the validation data and does not generalize very well.

<h2>Confusion Matrix</h2>

    Figure 3: Confusion matrix on the test set. The model predicted all cars as Gas:
    83 Gas cars were correctly classified, but 112 Electric cars were all
    misclassified as Gas. This leads to a final test accuracy of 42.56% and
    shows that the model completely fails to recognize the Electric class.

  <h3>Correct Predictions</h3>

    Figure 4: Examples where the model correctly predicted Gas for gas-powered
    vehicles. These examples show that the model has learned some useful gas-vehicle
    features such as body shape, lighting, and textures.

    Figure 5: Examples where Electric vehicles were incorrectly classified as Gas.
    Many of these cars look visually similar to gas sedans, which makes the problem
    harder. It also confirms that the model is heavily biased toward the Gas label.

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<div class="section">
  <ul>
    <li>The final test accuracy is <strong>42.56%</strong>, which is better than random guessing,
        but not good enough for real-world use.</li>
    <li>The model predicts only the Gas class, so recall for Electric cars is 0%.</li>
    <li>This behavior suggests class imbalance, limited training data, and the need for
        more tuning (more epochs, balanced dataset, stronger data augmentation).</li>
    <li>Even though the performance is limited, the project still demonstrates the complete
        pipeline of using AlexNet: data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and
        visualizing results.</li>
  </ul>
