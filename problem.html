    <h2>The Real-World Problem</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, cities, companies, and researchers need
        better ways to <strong>identify and track EVs versus gas-powered cars</strong>. Manual checks are
        slow and inconsistent, especially when there are thousands of vehicles in traffic footage or
        parking lots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Automated image-based classification can help support smarter infrastructure planning,
        emissions analysis, and sustainability reporting.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sustainability:</strong> EV adoption is tied to climate and emissions goals. Knowing how many EVs are on the road helps with policy decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Traffic & Infrastructure:</strong> Cities can design EV-only zones, charging stations, and parking based on accurate usage data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business Analytics:</strong> Parking garages, toll systems, and fleets may price or manage vehicles differently depending on fuel type.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        The dataset for this project includes images of electric and gas vehicles. The main structure is:
      </p>
      <pre>
train/
  eletric/
  gas/
valid/
  Electric/
  Regular/
      </pre>
      <p>
        All images are resized to <strong>227×227</strong> pixels and normalized so they can be used as
        input to AlexNet.
